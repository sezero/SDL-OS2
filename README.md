COMPILE TOOLS
===============
* Open Watcom V2 fork: http://open-watcom.github.io/open-watcom/
  https://github.com/open-watcom/
  https://github.com/open-watcom/travis-ci-ow-builds
  Note that Open Watcom 1.9.0 somehow miscompiles SDL-1.2.15 (or
  something is wrong in its crt, therefore the V2 fork is needed.)
