# SDL-OS2
SDL-1.2 Libraries for OS/2 and eComStation 

LICENSE
===============
* GNU LGPL v2

COMPILE TOOLS
===============
* Open Watcom 1.9
  - Note that OW1.9 was observed to miscompile SDL1.2 in the past (or
    something is wrong in its crt), so a newer version is recommended:

* Open Watcom snapshot builds from the 'official' perforce repository:
  - https://efbe.musca.uberspace.de/

* Open Watcom 'unofficial' V2 fork by Jiří Malák:
  - http://open-watcom.github.io/open-watcom/
  - https://github.com/open-watcom/
  - https://github.com/open-watcom/travis-ci-ow-builds
